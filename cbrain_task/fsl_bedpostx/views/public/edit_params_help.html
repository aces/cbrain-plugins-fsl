<h1>Task options for Bedpostx</h1>

Based on the FSL documentation at the <A HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fdt/fdt_bedpostx.html">FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox</A>

<P>

<b>Options:</b>
<ul>
    <li><b>Fibers:</b>Number of fibres modelled per voxel.</li>
    <li><b>Weight:</b>Multiplicative factor for the prior on the additional modelled fibres. A smaller factor means more weighting for the additional fibres.</li>
    <li><b>Burn in:</b>Number of iterations before starting the sampling. These might be increased if the data are noisy, and the MCMC needs more iterations to converge.</li>
</ul>
