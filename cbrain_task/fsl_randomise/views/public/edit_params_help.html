<h1>Randomise Options</h1>

<b><center>Not all options listed are provided on CBRAIN</center></b>
<center>To request additional options, leave feedback.</center>

<br>

<b>How to run randomise:</b>
<br><br>
Randomise allows you to run statistical tests for a given GLM, on many 4D input files.
On the file menu, choose the following:
  <ul>
    <li> One or more 4D files</li>
    <li> One mask file </li>
    <li> A design matrix collection. Please note that the design matrix collection can be one directory, or it can be different files you get from a typical GLM design (i.e. files with extensions .mat, .con, .grp etc). Note that you can choose either a directory or several files. If a directory is chosen, then CBRAIN will automatically assign the files to the appropriate randomise option. Make sure that if you choose a design directory, then you have included all necessary design files.</li>
</ul>

<b>CBRAIN options:</b>
<ul>
    <li><b>Number of permtation (-n):</b> number of permutations (default 5000, set to 0 for exhaustive).</li>

    <li><b>Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (-T):</b> carry out Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement.</li>
    <li><b>f cluster thresholding (-F):</b> carry out f cluster thresholding</li>
    <li><b>Output voxelwise (-x):</b> output voxelwise (corrected and uncorrected) p-value images.</li>
    <li><b>Output raw (-R):</b> output raw ( unpermuted ) statistic images.</li>
    <li><b>Design matrix file (-d):</b> design matrix file.</li>
    <li><b>t contrasts file (-t):</b> t contrasts file.</li>
    <li><b>f contrasts file (-f):</b> f contrasts file.</li>
    <li><b>Exchangeability block labels file (-e):</b> exchangeability block labels file.</li>
    <li><b>Mask image (-m):</b> mask image.</li>
    <li><b>Input (-i):</b> 4D input image.</li>
