<h1>FEAT options</h1>
<b><center>Not all options listed are provided on CBRAIN</center></b>
<center>To request additional options, leave feedback.</center>
<br>

This a preliminary version of FEAT in CBRAIN. It only supports First-level analysis pre-stats. </br>
Each input file will be an input of one FEAT, so CBRAIN will create one task for each input file.
</p>

For more information on FEAT, see the 
<a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/feat5/index.html" target="_blank">FEAT User Guide</a>
